# Hello there!

## Who am I?
My name is **Artem** and I am here to show what I can!
**Highly motivated**, slightly lazy but pationed software developer who likes to create **quality** software!
I would like to consider software development not as a _science_, but as an *art*!
Lacking strength in UI design 😅😅😅

## What I am doing?
I specialize in *software development* for different purposes. Starting from some basic WinForms application and ending something more complicated like AI application.

🛠️ Technologies I’m working with:
-C# / .NET Core
-Python
-WPF, .NET MAUI
-AI
-And always exploring more...

## Always ready to collaborate with different people andbuild something beatiful (and to learn of course)!
